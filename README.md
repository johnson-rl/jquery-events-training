### Reflection on this assignment

This assignment was challenging but fun.  I can see the utility of many of these skills which kept me motivated to move through all of the assignments.  I completed the first four with only a few issues, but the last one was a bit more challenging.  Together with Zach, Amber, and Mike, I was able to figure out how to use keypresses to make the code work.

Also...literally as I was typing this readme, Amber and I noticed that there was a Stretch Challenge that was much harder than everything we had done previously. We were able to get the site to count live, but couldn't get it to stop on the second keypress.  After much discussion, and a few different failed attempts, we finally got it to work, though we used a different method than what the solutions suggested.
